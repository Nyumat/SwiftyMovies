# SwiftyMovies

SwiftyMovies is a prototype movie database and favoriting app built with SwiftUI. The application implements the MVC design pattern. 

I haven't had much time to work on iOS development with school, so I created this app to break off the rust and get up-to-speed with Xcode 14 and Swift 5.7, as when I last did iOS dev, Xcode 12 had just released. 

## Getting Started

Clone the repository with this link:
```
https://github.com/Nyumat/SwiftyMovies.git
```

Navigate into the cloned directory:

``` 
cd SwiftyMovies  
```

Now, open Xcode and click as shown below:

Next, open the .xcodeproj folder in root dir:

Now you have the project locally!

> I appreciate how SwiftUI takes a declarative approach to building user interfaces. Prototyping the UI becomes quick and easy. I will definitely be building more fully-fleshed apps here soon. 

Here's the resultant application: (Demo)
